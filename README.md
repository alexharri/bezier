# Vector Networks

Started as a general exploration of bezier curves and then developed into a further exploration of how bezier curves are used and implemented in graphics software.

You can try out the project live [here](http://bezier.xlex.is/) and read more about it [here](https://alexharri.github.io/projects/bezier).
